Reflection:  Some of the challenges I faced were figuring out how to add the correct permissions to the account. When starting the assignment, I realized that I was not on a production account, but rather the root user, to which I logged into the root user account. I also struggled to figure out how to format the URL to display the correct information, as any mistakes will give me a permission requirement to access.
